Lab 01- Data Management and Metadata- README 

This lab is designed to introduce students to the foundational principles of clear, simple, and tidy data management. In tidy data all independent observations are entered as rows and all measured and nominal variables are entered as columns. As such this lab does not use R or RStudio but rather a simple spreadsheet manager. In our case we used Microsoft Excel as this is already familiar to many of our students. 

We provide students with some simple organisms where they can pick three morphometric traits to measure using a simple mm ruler. In the past we have used Freshwater snail shells but in the example here we used flowers of three different species of iris to mimic the commonly used “iris” R dataset. This example dataset also presents the opportunity to distinguish between numeric, integer and factor (categorical) variables. 

In a separate tab or worksheet we ask students to create a basic metadata file, defining each measured variable (column) and practice including as much detail as possible. 

We follow this with a simple exercise in summaries of data by calculating means, standard deviations and variances of the observed variables. 

We wrap up this lab by a very basic visualization of the data using a histogram. This will be further explored in R next week.
