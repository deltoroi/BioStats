Lab 02- Working with RStudio and RMarkdown 

This lab assumes that students have access to an institutional RStudio server or that students have the latest version of RStudio installed on their lab or personal computers. A 10 minute video guide to installing R and RStudio can be found on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEp1gRlTbMI&t=338s

Some of the basic vocabulary and syntax used in the subsequent labs and a general introduction to working directories and R libraries can be found in these videos:

I recommend spending some time with students describing working directories and different ways of accessing them in RStudio. Either through code using “setwd()” or by following the menu option Session>Set Working Directory >Choose Directory  and then browsing to the working directory. 

Once students load the Lab02_Template.rdm file, they will see a prepared and blank markdown file with five chunks. The header information on lines 1-8 can be manipulated to include the student name and date, as well as help to prepare a table of contents. A table of contents makes the evaluation of labs a bit simpler for the assessor.  Any time a new function is introduced, the supplementary help files are referenced as the first part of the chunk using the "?" Syntax 

Outside of the five chunks students, will have the list of objectives they should complete within each chunk. Please encourage students to constantly save their code . Chunks 1-4 work with the InsectSprays dataset and chunk 5 works with the iris dataset.
